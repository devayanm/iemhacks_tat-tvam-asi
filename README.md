## Problem Overview

In the fast-paced world of academia, the mental health challenges that students face are often overlooked. The isolation, stress, and anxiety can become overwhelming, and the lack of understanding from peers who haven't walked the same path can exacerbate these feelings. The need for a safe haven, a place to connect without fear of judgment, is more crucial than ever. Unfortunately, mainstream social platforms fall short in providing the sensitivity and confidentiality required for these deeply personal conversations.

## EmpathConnect: Where Support Meets Understanding
